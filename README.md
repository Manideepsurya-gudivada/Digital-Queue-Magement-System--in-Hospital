# MediQueue Pro

This is a Next.js starter in Firebase Studio for MediQueue Pro, a digital queue management system for hospitals.

## Key Functional Modules

### 1. Patient History & Record Retrieval
- Retrieve complete medical history for returning patients.
- Store visit details, prescriptions, lab reports, and consultation summaries.
- AI summarizer to auto-generate a short medical summary from past visits.

### 2. Advanced Case Study Management
- Search, filter, and retrieve case studies of similar symptoms or diseases.
- Categorize studies by specialization, keywords, or diagnosis.
- Doctor can link a patient record to an existing case study for learning or follow-up.
- AI engine suggests related case studies using keyword similarity (NLP).

### 3. Smart Queue & Appointment Insights
- Predict waiting time dynamically based on doctor’s activity and patient count.
- Visual dashboard showing live queue, average consultation time, and doctor status.
- Auto-notifications to patients when their turn is near or delayed.

### 4. Doctor Dashboard
- View all current patients and their histories.
- Access quick links to patient’s old records and case studies.

### 5. Admin Analytics Dashboard
- Real-time hospital stats — patient inflow, department efficiency, case study growth.
- Exportable reports (PDF/CSV).
- Role management for doctors, staff, and patients.

### 6. AI & Automation Enhancements
- AI Symptom Search: Doctor can input symptoms → system suggests possible similar case studies.
- NLP Search Engine: “Show me all diabetes-related case studies in cardiology.”
- Predictive Analytics: Estimate patient load and doctor performance using ML models.
- Chatbot Assistant: Patients can ask, “When is my turn?” or “Show my last visit details.”

## Expected Outcome
An intelligent hospital management system that:
- Automatically retrieves and summarizes previous patient data.
- Suggests relevant medical case studies using AI/NLP.
- Enables smarter decision-making and collaborative learning.
- Improves patient experience with predictive queue management.
